# SixColors Theme: an Emacs theme for nostalgic Apple users

This is my personal Emacs theme that is based on the original six colors of the old Apple logo.
If you like it, don't forget to check out also [SixColors-mode](https://github.com/mastro35/sixcolors-mode).

## Installation

This package is published on the Milkypostmanâ€™s Emacs Lisp Package Archive, better known as [MELPA](https://melpa.org/), the best repository for Emacs Packages out there.
To install it, just add the Melpa repository to your init file and then 

```elisp
(use-package sixcolors-theme :ensure t)
(load-theme 'sixcolors t)
```
That's it!
